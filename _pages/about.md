Welcome to my site!

I am an undergraduate at the [Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/). I am currently in the final semester of my B.Tech. degree. I have been passionate about Artificial Intelligence ever since I first started exploring it in the first year of my degree. My current interests lie mostly in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Neuro-Symbolic AI. I am always enthusiastic about opportunities to explore these fields in greater depth through projects. 

I am currently working on Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion at the [Data Analytics and Intelligence Research](https://github.com/dair-iitd) group under the supervision of Prof. [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam) and Prof. [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/). I am also fortunate to be working on the generation of Land Use-Land Cover maps from satellite time series data in the [Appropriate Computing Technologies for Development](http://act4d.iitd.ernet.in/) group under the supervision of Prof. [Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/). 

I interned at [D.E. Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/) as a Member Technical Intern in the Strategy Tech department at the end of my third year in college. I have played table tennis at the inter-hostel level, and also enjoy quizzing and video games.
