Welcome to my site!

I am a second year MS Computer Science candidate at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I was previously an undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/). My current interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing. I am interested in improving the generalization and reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models, with a focus on interpretable approaches such as algorithmic distillation. I also have research experience in the fields of LLM safety, chatbot design, human-computer interaction, machine learning on graphs, remote sensing, drug discovery and extreme classification.  

I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/) under the supervision of Prof. [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/), working on a method to induce [syntactic inductive biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18885) in transformer language models without any architectural modifications. I have also worked with Prof. [Dan Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/), Prof. [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/), Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html) and Prof. [Tatsunori Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/) on various NLP-related projects over the past year. These include a [domain-specific language](https://mdoumbouya.github.io/h4rm3l/) for jailbreak attack synthesis, a robust optimization method to boost the performance of worst-performing langauges while training multilingual speech recognition models, and a [chatbot](https://roleplay-doh.github.io/) that enables domain experts to tailor LLM-based psychotherapy patient simulations for roleplay practice.

I have previously worked on [augmentation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.23/) and [ensembling](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.20/) techniques for Knowledge Graph Completion at the [Data Analytics and Intelligence Research](https://github.com/dair-iitd) group under the supervision of Prof. [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam) and Prof. [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/). I have also worked on the generation of [Land Use-Land Cover maps](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/%7Easeth/commons-connect-ictd2024.pdf) from satellite time series data in the [Appropriate Computing Technologies for Development](http://act4d.iitd.ernet.in/) group under the supervision of Prof. [Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/).

I interned at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/) as a ML Researcher Intern over the summer, in Seattle. I worked on semantic parsing of natural language queries into executable statements in an internal query language, as well as an enterprise CoPilot. In India, I did a 7-month stint as a part-time AI researcher intern at [KnowDis Data Science](https://www.knowdis.ai/), where I worked on problems related to NLP (multilingual idiom alignment, spelling-robust language identification), extreme classification, and drug discovery. I also interned at [D.E. Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/) as a Member Technical Intern in the Strategy Tech department at the end of my third year in college. I have played table tennis/ping pong for more than a decade and cricket at the Under-14 and Under-17 levels, and also enjoy quizzing and video games.
