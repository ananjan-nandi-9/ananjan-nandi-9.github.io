Welcome to my site!

I am a first year MS Computer Science candidate at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I was previously an undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/). My current interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing, specifically, understanding and eliciting reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models for complex tasks. I have prior research experience in the fields of NLP, ML on Graphs, remote sensing, drug discovery and extreme classification.  

I am currently working on projects at [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/) under the supervision of Prof. [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/) and Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html). I am working on understanding and improving compositional generalization in transformer architectures under the supervision of [Shikhar Murty](https://murtyshikhar.github.io/) and Prof. Manning. I am also working on improving [CARE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08982.pdf): an AI-powered platform to train peer counselors through suggestion generation based on conversation history in Prof. Diyi Yang's lab.    

I have previously worked on augmentation and ensembling techniques for Knowledge Graph Completion at the [Data Analytics and Intelligence Research](https://github.com/dair-iitd) group under the supervision of Prof. [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam) and Prof. [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/). I have also worked on the generation of Land Use-Land Cover maps from satellite time series data in the [Appropriate Computing Technologies for Development](http://act4d.iitd.ernet.in/) group under the supervision of Prof. [Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/).

I have done a 7-month stint as a part-time AI researcher intern at [KnowDis Data Science](https://www.knowdis.ai/), where I worked on problems related to NLP (multilingual idiom alignment, spelling-robust language identification), extreme classification, and drug discovery. I also interned at [D.E. Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/) as a Member Technical Intern in the Strategy Tech department at the end of my third year in college. I have played table tennis at the inter-hostel level and cricket at the inter-club level, and also enjoy quizzing and video games.
