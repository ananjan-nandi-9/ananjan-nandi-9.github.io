## About Me

I am an incoming PhD candidate in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) currently advised by [Monica Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/). I am primarily interested in enhancing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of language models by leveraging structure inherent in training data. As a result, I am exploring approaches for automatically curating structured training data and developing methods that enable models to learn interpretable, robust algorithms by effectively leveraging this structure. 

When I am not doing research, you can usually find me at a table tennis table. Over the past year, I have hiked in five different U.S. states, and I spent a lot of my childhood exploring the Indian Himalayas. I am also into video games, enjoy most kinds of music, and love horror in all forms of media.


## Experience
My research has spanned fields including [syntactic language modeling](https://www.treereg.dev/), [LLM jailbreaking](https://mdoumbouya.github.io/h4rm3l/), [speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01777), [information retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01994) and [AI for mental health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00870). I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/). 

I am fortunate to have worked with [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/), [Dan Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/), [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/), [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html) and [Tatsunori Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/) at the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/), as well as [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam), [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/) and [Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/) at IIT Delhi. I have also interned at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/), [KnowDis Data Science](https://www.knowdis.ai/) and [D.E. Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/).
