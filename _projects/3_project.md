### Abstract

Creating realistic simulated patients for medical training is challenging and expensive. We introduce **Roleplay-doh**, a framework that enables domain experts to create LLM-simulated patients by eliciting and adhering to principles. 

Our approach allows medical professionals to define patient characteristics and behaviors through natural language principles, which are then used to guide LLM responses. This democratizes the creation of high-quality simulated patients while maintaining clinical accuracy and educational value.

The framework bridges the gap between medical expertise and AI technology, allowing healthcare professionals to create sophisticated training scenarios without requiring deep technical knowledge. By leveraging principles-based guidance, we ensure that simulated patients behave consistently and realistically across different interactions.

### Key Features

- **Principle-based guidance**: Medical experts define patient behaviors through natural language principles
- **Consistent patient simulation**: Maintains character consistency across interactions
- **Accessible to domain experts**: No technical expertise required for creating simulated patients
- **Educational value**: Designed specifically for medical training scenarios
