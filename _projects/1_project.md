Abstract: High-quality rules are imperative to the success of Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph (KG)
models because they equip the models with the desired qualities of interpretability and generalizability. Though necessary, learning logic rules is an inherently hard task. The past rule learning models in KGs have either struggled to learn rules at the scale required for large KGs or the rules learnt by such models are of poor-quality and not diverse. To address this limitation, we propose two novel ways of feeding more high-quality rules to Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph reasoning models. Specifically, we augment the existing set of logic rules of a KG model by exploiting the concepts of abduction and rule inversion. Our proposed
approach is generic and is applicable to most neuro-symbolic KG models in literature. Experiments on three datasets prove that our proposed approach obtains upto 23% MR and 7% MRR gains over the base models.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
