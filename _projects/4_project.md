### Abstract

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to achieve better performance than individual models. However, traditional ensembles use static combinations that don't adapt to different inputs. We introduce **DynaSemble**, a dynamic ensembling approach that intelligently selects and weights ensemble members based on input characteristics.

Our method learns to predict which models will perform best for specific inputs, leading to improved accuracy and robustness across diverse datasets. Rather than using fixed weights for all inputs, DynaSemble adapts its combination strategy based on the characteristics of each individual input.

### Key Innovations

- **Input-aware model selection**: Dynamically chooses the best models for each input
- **Adaptive weighting**: Adjusts model weights based on input characteristics
- **Improved robustness**: Better performance across diverse datasets and domains
- **Computational efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead by selective model usage

### Results

DynaSemble demonstrates significant improvements over static ensembling methods across multiple benchmarks, showing particular strength in handling diverse and challenging inputs where different models excel.
